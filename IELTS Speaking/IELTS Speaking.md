2. Study or Work
   - Why did you choose to study that subject/major?
     
     > For a couple of  reasons, Firstly, mainly due to my father's occupation, he works in this industry and would like me to follow his footsteps, and secondly, because it's very demanding and I really like making electronic products.
	- Do you like your subject/major?(Why/Why not)
   
	  > Yes, I think so, especially when I have the opportunity to touch some experiments related to my major, such as Participating in college student electronic competition  and projects research, I find it interesting and hope one day I can make my own electronic products.
   
	- Which subject do you like the least?
	
     > I would say it's history. I find it extremelly boring and difficult to memorise.  You know, I always find myself struggling with the important dates and facts in history.
   
   - Are you look forward to working?
	
	  > (yes)Yes, I am. Speaking in the short term, I still need to study hard and gain some work experience, such as  taking  a summer internship (in Huawei). While in the long run, I need to add more experience to make my CV/resume look better and get more interview. Which can help me (get more opportunity to) find the ideal job in the competitive world.
	  > (No)
	
	- Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoons?
	
	   >I would say it's morning, because studying in the morning will always be beneficial as my refreshed and energized mind after a good night's sleep. Plus in the morning the nature is awake and there is a general silence everywhere which helps me to concentrate better!  
	   
	   > For me, studying in the morning is definitely better. You know, it's the best time to memorise things and the learning efficiency would be higher, no doubt. But if I work in the afternoon, I will feel drowsy and fail to concentrate on my study.

   - Do you like math/mathematics?
   
      >Yes, I do. For a couple of reasons, Firstly I'm especially into solving the difficult math problems because I enjoy the feeling to concentrate on the math problems and figure them out. And secondly, using mathematics can explain the principles of some things in our daily life, which gave me a sense of achievement. 
   
   - Is math difficult for you to learn?
   
       >No, It's not really hard for me to solve/figure out the difficlut mathematical problems, because I have a solid mathematical foundation and I am sensitive with numbers. You know, every math problem has it's rules, and if we can find out the rules, then we will get the right answer.
   
   - Do you like to use a calculator when doing mathematics?
   
       >As for me, I think using a calculator is really time-consuming so I don't enjoy/like using it. Even though some people say that it is convenient and you don't need to count the numbers by yourself, it won't help you to promote your own math strength.

     > Yes, for sure. It's necessary for us all to learn history. You know, we can gain precious experience from the past and learn a lot from the wise ancient people. Imaging without the lessons from history, we would have to start everything from scratch and make lots of mistake.

5. Study efficiency

   - What do you do to improve your learning efficiency?

(At the same time, my university is also in my hometown, so I have stayed/live there for almost 24 years,)I had stayed there for almost 18 years until I went to university, So  I can say many things about my hometown because I know it well. I know where you can find tasty food and what kinds of special local products.

   - Is there a big city or a small place?

     > I would say my hometown is a small city because (it has only about 1million people, you know, In China, most cities have more than 5 million people. ) it has a small number of  population, with a slow-paced lifestyle and not prosperous even depressed economic development. I feel comfortable living there, on the one hand, the air is extremely fresh because it is close to mountains. On the other hand, even though there are a range of entertainment facilities, the housing price is still low.
